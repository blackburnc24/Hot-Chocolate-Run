# Hot Chocolate Run - Charlotte 2025 🏃‍♂️☕️

This project displays a map of Uptown Charlotte and the route that the 10k race ran. 
Map readers will be able to see where the race started, some landmarks that occurred throughout the race, and the end of the race. 

A interactive leaflet map is used with a custom basemap from Carto ('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png').
The route was from a race I recently ran and the GPX was downloaded from Strava (https://www.strava.com/)
Flag icons are used as place markers, which are clickable to view embedded images and text descriptions.

A link is provided for the Charlotte Hot Chocolate Run Website (https://hotchocolate15k.com/city/charlotte/)

Javascript, CSS, and Leaflet were used. The plugin Font Awesome was also used for the flag place markers.
